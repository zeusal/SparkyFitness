# New Migration

Canonical copy. `.claude/skills/new-migration/SKILL.md` is a stub pointing here, the same way `CLAUDE.md` points at `AGENTS.md`.

Read and follow `agent-docs/new-migration-checklist.md` at the repo root, completing every checkbox — do not skip the schema mirrors (step 3) or documentation (step 4) sections; they are the most commonly forgotten steps and have caused RLS bugs before.

Work through the checklist in order:

1. Migration file in `SparkyFitnessServer/db/migrations/` (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`)
2. RLS policies in `SparkyFitnessServer/db/rls_policies.sql`
3. Schema mirror: `shared/src/schemas/database/<Table>.zod.ts` (exported from `shared/src/index.ts`); leave `db_schema_backup.sql` alone — CI regenerates it after merge via an automated sync PR
4. Docs: `docs/content/2.features/9.family-friends-sharing.md` + `docs/content/8.developer/11.database-security-tiers.md` (assign Tier 1/2/3)
5. Downstream API contracts (server route/schema/tests, web, mobile)
6. Validate: boot the server so migrations + RLS reapply, then `pnpm run validate` and nearby tests

Before finishing, re-open the checklist and confirm each item is done or explicitly not applicable, and say which.
