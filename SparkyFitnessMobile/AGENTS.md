SparkyFitness Mobile is a React Native 0.85 + Expo SDK 56 app for syncing Apple Health / Health Connect data with the SparkyFitness backend, tracking nutrition, hydration, fasting, measurements, exercise, saved foods, meal templates, custom exercises, workout presets, iOS / Android widgets, the active workout HUD, and the Sparky AI chat.

This is the package guide for `SparkyFitnessMobile/`. Work from this directory for mobile implementation and validation. If a task crosses into the backend, frontend, or `shared/`, read that package guide too before editing outside mobile.

## Scope And Style

- TypeScript is strict. Keep changes type-safe and compiling cleanly.
- Prefer small, direct changes that fit the existing screen, hook, and service boundaries.
- For ambiguous bugs, prove which layer is failing before patching. One narrow diagnostic check beats speculative edits across multiple layers.
- Do not replace a working implementation with a rewrite unless the requester explicitly approves that direction.
- When asked to plan work, confirm scope with clarifying questions before exploring code or drafting the plan.
- Run scripts from `SparkyFitnessMobile/`, except root package operations such as `pnpm install` for patched dependencies.
- Treat `android/` and `ios/` as generated output when possible. Edit `app.config.ts`, `plugins/`, `targets/`, JS/TS sources, or patch files first, then regenerate with prebuild when needed.

## Stack And Imports

- Primary stack: React 19.2, React Native 0.85, Expo SDK 56, TypeScript 6, React Navigation 7, TanStack Query 5, Uniwind / TailwindCSS v4, Reanimated 4, Skia, Victory Native, Expo Background Task / Task Manager / Notifications, Zustand, assistant-ui + AI SDK (chat).
- `@/*` maps to this package and `@workspace/shared` maps to `../shared/src/index.ts`.
- Prefer `@workspace/shared` schemas, constants, date/timezone helpers, and types over local duplicates.
- The app talks to the backend under `/api`; health uploads go to `POST /api/health-data`.
- Global `fetch` is Expo's WinterCG `expo/fetch`, so React Native's `{uri, name, type}` FormData file parts throw "Unsupported FormDataPart implementation". Append an `expo-file-system` `File` (it implements Blob) for multipart uploads; see `pregnancyPhotosApi.ts`.
- Server-stored distance/weight units are metric. UI conversion belongs in mobile helpers such as `unitConversions.ts`.

## Localization contract

English (`en`) is the canonical source locale and the deterministic fallback. Feature developers must add/update the English catalog, use semantic static keys, provide explicit English fallback/defaultValue text, use count-based i18next pluralization, use app-locale date/number/unit formatters, and avoid user-facing hardcoded text. Custom, user, and server content stays literal.

Feature developers do not need to know or translate Polish or any future language, and do not need to wait for Weblate. Translators/Weblate own Polish and future translations and linguistic QA. Missing translation content is non-blocking and falls back to English; existing translated content remains structurally validated.

The shipped locale registry is `src/localization/localeRegistry.json`, read through the typed accessors in `src/localization/localeRegistry.ts`. Adding a catalog to Weblate does not ship it. Shipping requires explicit registry enablement plus native/platform support verification. RN catalogs and native resources are separate surfaces (Expo metadata, Android widget resources, and iOS widget/Live Activity `.lproj` resources), each its own Weblate component and each synced by `.github/workflows/sync-translations.yml`. Only the `en` side of any surface is edited by hand; the i18n audit blocks on registered locales and reports unregistered ones without failing. The workflow pulls the widget resources for registered locales only, because Android and iOS compile whatever resource directories are present and there is no build-time registry check for them.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm start
pnpm run ios
pnpm run android
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run validate
pnpm exec jest --watchman=false --runInBand
pnpm exec jest --watchman=false --runInBand <test-path>
pnpm run test:coverage -- --watchman=false --runInBand
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

- `pnpm run validate` runs i18n generate check, typecheck, lint, i18n audit, Knip (`pnpm run knip` for unused files and exports), and native locales check together.
- Use Watchman-disabled Jest commands in agent/sandbox runs; bare Jest often fails on macOS.
- `collectCoverage` is enabled in Jest config, so expect coverage output from normal test runs.
- Run `npx expo prebuild --clean` after native dependency changes, permissions, app group or widget target changes, Expo plugin changes, native config edits, or patching native modules.
- After editing the root `patches/react-native-health-connect@3.5.3.patch`, run `pnpm install` from the repo root, then prebuild from mobile.

## App Shell And Navigation

- `App.tsx` is the root composition point. `App()` wraps `QueryClientProvider`, `KeyboardProvider`, `GestureHandlerRootView`, and `BottomSheetModalProvider`; `AppContent()` owns `NavigationContainer`, `SafeAreaProvider`, navigators, `AddSheet`, auth modals, the embedded/floating active-workout bars, the tab-bar `WhatsNewBanner`, and toasts.
- App-shell logic lives in dedicated hooks that `AppContent` composes: `useAppBootstrap` (`src/hooks/useAppBootstrap.ts`) owns language initialization, initial-route selection, the initial linking-enabled state, and splash hiding; `useAppStartup` (`src/hooks/useAppStartup.ts`) owns the one-time startup services (theme, notifications, notification actions, background sync, HealthKit observers); `useAutoSyncOnOpen` (`src/hooks/useAutoSyncOnOpen.ts`) for cold-start/foreground-return sync and the observer-yield window; `useAddSheetActions` (`src/hooks/useAddSheetActions.ts`) for AddSheet handlers and last-active-tab tracking. Error-boundary-wrapped `Safe*` screen components live in `src/navigation/safeScreens.tsx`.
- Startup initializes theme, haptics, sounds, notification prefs, logs, timezone bootstrap, background sync, pending cache refreshes, fasting/hydration card visibility, and platform health observers.
- Initial route comes from `getActiveServerConfig()` inside `useAppBootstrap`: no active config lands on `Onboarding`; otherwise users enter `Tabs`. A language-initialization failure is logged and never changes the route.
- Deep links are enabled only after startup confirms `Tabs`, so widget links do not bypass first-run onboarding.
- Navigation source of truth is `App.tsx` plus `src/types/navigation.ts`; update both and the linking config when routes change.
- Root stack uses `@react-navigation/native-stack`. Tabs use `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`.
- Tabs are `Dashboard`, `Diary`, `Add`, `Library`, and `Settings`. `Add` is a center action in `CustomTabBar`, not a content screen.
- Native iOS Liquid Glass tabs use `@bottom-tabs/react-navigation` in `src/components/TabsLayout.tsx`; each content tab is wrapped in its own `createNativeStackNavigator` so the tab path still gets native headers.
- `TabsLayout` switches at runtime via `useNativeIOSTabsActive()` (`services/nativeTabBarPreference.ts`): native tabs require iOS 26+ Liquid Glass support AND the user's `liquidGlassTabBarEnabled` preference (opt-in). Everything else renders `CustomTabBar` (`TAB_BAR_HEIGHT = 56`); `ActiveWorkoutBar` reads the native tab-bar height instead when native tabs are active.
- When adding a root-stack screen, add the route to `RootStackParamList` and register a matching `<Stack.Screen>` in `App.tsx` with `createStackScreenOptions(...)` or equivalent explicit iOS native-stack header options.
- Native header option/button builders live in `utils/nativeHeaderItems.ts` (`createIOSNativeHeaderOptions`, `createIOSSmallNativeHeaderOptions`, text/icon button items); header action colors come from `useHeaderActionColors`, which is Liquid-Glass-aware on iOS.
- Root-stack screens with a screen-owned React header are automatically checked by `__tests__/navigation/nativeHeaderContract.test.ts`; do not add screen-specific native-header allowlists.
- Root-stack screens with a screen-owned React header and a real back button must set `headerBackTitle` or `headerBackButtonDisplayMode: 'minimal'` in `App.tsx` so iOS back labels stay explicit or intentionally hidden; close/cancel modal headers do not need either option.
- Declare screen headers with `useScreenHeader(config)` (`src/hooks/useScreenHeader.tsx`). One declarative descriptor (`title`/`nativeTitle`, `left`/`right` items of kind `back`/`dismiss`/`text`/`icon`/`primary`/`menu`, `busy`/`disabled`, `animateKey` for view↔edit cross-fades) renders both paths: on the native path it mirrors items into `unstable_header{Left,Right}Items` via a layout effect and returns `null`; on the custom path it returns the bar element for the screen to render. A `menu` item is a declarative dropdown (plain actions and/or titled single-select sections, optional accent-dot `showsBadge`): the native path builds a system UIMenu header button, the custom path renders the trigger plus an `AnchoredMenu` under it — one item list drives both, as in `FoodsLibraryScreen`'s ownership filter. Hook screens must not keep hand-rolled header code (no `unstable_header*Items` blocks or custom bars alongside the hook) — the contract test enforces this.
- Path selection is `useNativeIOSHeadersActive()` (`services/nativeTabBarPreference.ts`): always false on Android; on iOS it is true below iOS 26 (classic native headers) and follows the Liquid Glass toggle on iOS 26+, so turning the toggle off swaps in the same screen-owned fallback headers Android renders.
- One-accent rule: exactly one primary header action per screen (`kind: 'primary'` or `role: 'primary'`), enforced with a `__DEV__` throw; primary header save buttons fall back to the localized `t('common.save')` / `t('common.saving')` labels when no `label`/`busyLabel` is supplied. Footer-save forms mark their header Save `placement: 'native-only'` so the custom bar does not duplicate the sticky-footer button. `onPress` handlers dispatch through the hook's internal ref map — do not add per-screen handler-ref effects for native header buttons.
- A **right-slot** `kind: 'primary'` press is wrapped in the shared synchronous duplicate-press guard (`utils/duplicatePress.ts`, same one `FooterSaveBar` uses): presses inside `DUPLICATE_PRESS_WINDOW_MS` collapse to one. `disabled`/`busy` are React state and have not committed when taps queued behind a blocked JS thread replay, so every queued press otherwise ran the handler again (#2191). The guard is deliberately time-based, not a latch on `busy`, because handlers that never report a pending state would leave the button dead. **Left-slot** primaries are exempt — that slot is navigation, and `CycleOnboardingScreen` uses the sugar for a wizard Back where repeated presses are intended. A screen that needs a rapidly repeatable right-slot action must not use `kind: 'primary'`.
- If a root-stack screen is intentionally presented above `Tabs` instead of inside native-tabs mode, document it in `NATIVE_TABS_ROUTE_EXCLUSIONS` in `__tests__/navigation/nativeHeaderContract.test.ts` with a short reason.
- Screens intentionally off the hook (e.g. `FoodSearchScreen`'s bespoke anchored-menu bar) must mirror custom actions with `unstable_header{Left,Right}Items` themselves, hide the screen-owned React header behind `useNativeIOSHeadersActive()` with a guard such as `{!usesNativeHeader && <Header />}`, and gate the `useLayoutEffect` that sets native header items on the same flag; otherwise iOS renders both headers.
- When adding a tab, update `TabParamList`, `NativeTab.Screen`, and `FallbackTab.Screen`; for content tabs also add a tab-local native stack screen using `createIOSNativeHeaderOptions(...)`.
- `__tests__/navigation/nativeHeaderContract.test.ts` enforces this native-header wiring. If it fails, fix the route/type/navigator alignment instead of weakening the test.
- Current stack screens include onboarding/tabs, library/detail/form flows for foods/meals/meal plans/exercises/presets, food entry view/edit, meal type detail and copy, the family diary flows (`FamilyMembers`, `FamilyDiary`, `FamilyMealDetail`, and `FamilyCopyReview`), `EditBarcode`, food search/entry/scan/photo flow, workout/activity add/detail, exercise/preset search, settings subscreens, logs, sync, measurements, the progress photo flow (`ProgressPhotos`, `ProgressPhotoCompare`, and `ProgressPhotoTimelapse`), fasting, and `WhatsNew`.
- `AddSheet` offers Food, Workout, Activity, Preset, Measurements, Scan Food, Progress Photos, Ask Sparky, and Sync Health Data. Its Progress Photos row opens `ProgressPhotos` on the diary's active date. Keep its present/dismiss refs intact to avoid Android re-present loops.
- `useNavigationActionGuard` locks navigation-triggering actions while a native-stack transition is running (idle-callback unlock on re-focus, 5s safety release) so double-taps cannot queue duplicate screens; Library create actions use it.
- `ActiveWorkoutBar` is mounted outside normal screen trees, uses the root navigation ref, and hides itself on modal/editor routes such as food search/forms/scan/photo, exercise search, workout/activity add, measurements, and barcode edit.
- Most screens are wrapped with `withErrorBoundary(...)`; `SettingsScreen` also uses section-level recovery so settings remain reachable.

## Source Map

- `src/components/` - reusable UI, charts, settings rows, custom tab bar, add sheet, workout HUD, form chrome, library rows, diary rows, serving sheets, food/workout editors, fasting UI, writeback UI, and `ui/` primitives.
- `src/components/auth/` - MFA UI shared by onboarding, setup, and reauth.
- `src/screens/` - top-level route destinations: dashboard, diary, family member/diary/meal/copy-review flows, settings, sync, logs, Whats New, fasting, food search/scan/photo, library CRUD flows, workout/activity flows, and measurement entry.
- `src/navigation/` - navigation-level modules such as `safeScreens.tsx`, the error-boundary-wrapped screen components registered in `App.tsx`. (`FoodPhotoFlow` lives in `src/components/`.)
- `src/hooks/` - TanStack Query hooks, auth/connection hooks, library/search/mutation hooks, measurement/water/check-in hooks, fasting hooks, workout form hooks, widget sync, query client, query keys, and cache helpers.
- `src/services/api/` - backend clients. `apiClient.ts` handles normal API auth/proxy headers; `healthDataApi.ts`, `aiSettingsApi.ts`, food-photo estimate, and other raw fetch paths must keep auth, proxy, timeout, and session-expiry behavior aligned.
- `src/services/healthconnect/` - Android Health Connect reads, native aggregation, transformation, enrichment, preferences, and writeback.
- `src/services/healthkit/` - iOS HealthKit reads, statistics aggregation, transformation, background delivery, preferences, and writeback.
- `src/services/shared/` - platform-agnostic health helpers: the `collectHealthData` / `runForegroundSync` engine both orchestrators share, the per-run workout-telemetry budget and its reuse cache, Health Connect error classification, sample downsampling, day aggregation/transformation, preference factories, and permission migration/sets.
- `src/services/` - platform health orchestration, writeback re-exports, background sync, auto-sync coordination, diagnostics, calculations, logging, storage, theme, haptics, sounds, notifications, food photo intro, meal selection, boolean preferences, card visibility, and workout drafts.
- `src/stores/` - Zustand stores, including the persisted active workout/rest timer store.
- `src/utils/` - date helpers, unit conversion, food details, meal nutrition, nutrient display, workout/session helpers, fasting formatting, numeric input, concurrency, sync utilities, duplicate-press guarding, photo estimate error mapping, and rate limiting.
- `src/constants/` - meal, exercise, fasting, and nutrient metadata.
- JS bridges to native modules live in `src/services/` (`CalorieWidgetBridge.ts`, `ExactAlarmBridge.ts`); there is no `src/native/` directory.
- `plugins/`, `targets/widget/`, `targets/android-widget/`, `targets/android-exact-alarm/` - Expo plugins and widget/native extension sources.

## React Query And Local State

- Query setup lives in `src/hooks/queryClient.ts`; keys live in `src/hooks/queryKeys.ts`.
- Default `staleTime` is `Infinity`, so mutations must explicitly invalidate or update affected caches.
- `useRefetchOnFocus(refetch, enabled)` is the standard focus-refresh hook.
- `useFoodsLibrary` is an intentional exception with an infinite query, finite stale window, and `resetQueries(...)` refreshes so focus/pull refresh reloads page 1 instead of every cached page.
- Meal mutations invalidate meals, recent meals, search, and details; food entry creation can affect recent meals.
- Exercise/workout preset list/search/detail invalidation belongs in their mutation hooks.
- `useUpsertCheckIn` updates measurement queries and calls `refreshHealthSyncCache(queryClient)`.
- `useWaterIntakeMutation` fetches `waterContainersQueryKey`, persists the selected container, and optimistically updates `dailySummaryQueryKey(date)`.
- Active-server switches clear React Query state before refetching connection state.
- Error-boundary retry flows call `queryClient.resetQueries()`.
- App-local toggles live in `stores/appPreferencesStore.ts` (Zustand `persist`, single AsyncStorage key `@SparkyFitness/app-preferences`): haptics, sounds, notifications, hydration/fasting card visibility, Ask Sparky and progress photos card visibility, the Liquid Glass tab bar opt-in, the active-workout metric column, the default rest period (`defaultRestSec`, edited in `WorkoutSettingsScreen`), and the Health Trends layout (`healthTrendOrder` + `hiddenHealthTrends`, edited in `HealthTrendsSettingsScreen`). The Health Trends pair is written through the single `setHealthTrendLayout(order, hiddenKeys)` setter rather than one per field, because one drag changes order and visibility together; a saved order is reconciled against `constants/healthTrends.ts` by `resolveHealthTrendOrder`, so registering a new graph needs no `STORE_VERSION` bump. Consume via selectors (`useAppPreferencesStore((s) => s.hapticsEnabled)`) plus generated setters; non-React code reads current values through helpers like `getDefaultRestSec()`. A legacy-aware storage adapter migrates the old per-key `@HealthConnect:*` values once. These preferences never sync to the server.

## Health Sync

- `src/services/healthConnectService.ts` is Android orchestration; `src/services/healthConnectService.ios.ts` is iOS orchestration. They are substantial platform implementations, not thin wrappers.
- Both orchestrators batch metric reads with `runTasksInBatches`, a concurrency of 3, and per-metric timeouts. Preserve timeout and partial-error handling.
- Bootstrap timezone state before sync. `ensureTimezoneBootstrapped(...)` runs at startup and `healthDataApi.ts` enforces it before upload.
- Preserve `record_timezone` and `record_utc_offset_minutes` when available.
- Manual sync, sync-on-open, foreground-return sync, background sync, and iOS observer-triggered sync share coordination logic. Preserve claim/in-flight guards and cooldown recording.
- Health uploads are chunked. Simple measurements use large chunks; sleep sessions use smaller session chunks; exercise/workout records are grouped by source to match server delete-then-insert behavior.
- Sync result objects include `syncErrors`; callers should surface partial failures and avoid advancing `lastSyncedTime` when any metric read failed.
- `backgroundSyncService.ts` uses overlap windows for sessions and day-aligned rolling windows for cumulative metrics and nutrition. Do not collapse those into one naive window.
- On iOS, cumulative metrics should use HealthKit statistics queries, not raw sample summation.
- On Android, cumulative metrics (`Steps`, `Distance`, `ActiveCaloriesBurned`, `TotalCaloriesBurned`, `FloorsClimbed`) use Health Connect `aggregateGroupByPeriod` once per range. Native source-priority dedup should match Health Connect UI; do not reintroduce JS `Math.max` or source allowlist dedup.
- Android read helpers return `{ records, error }` via `readHealthRecordsDetailed` and `aggregateCumulativeMetricByDayDetailed`; legacy wrappers unwrap only records.
- Android exercise sessions are enriched with `aggregateRecord` for active, total, and basal calories plus distance and steps over the session window. Active/total calories start scoped to `dataOrigin`, while basal energy remains unfiltered; `total - basal` is compared as an active-energy candidate. Incomplete or implausible active/total pairs retry without the origin filter so Health Connect can apply source priority. Distance and steps always stay origin-scoped; never infer workout steps from an unfiltered clock-window query.
- iOS exercise-session steps must come from statistics attached directly to the `HKWorkout`. Do not infer workout steps by querying all step samples in the workout's clock window.
- iOS HealthKit locked-device failures surface as database-inaccessible warnings. Do not treat these as successful empty reads.
- `app.config.ts` grants `android.permission.health.READ_HEALTH_DATA_HISTORY` so Android can read data older than 30 days.
- Health Connect permission migrations belong in `services/shared/healthPermissionMigration.ts`, not UI-only state.
- Core check-in measurements use `measurementsApi.ts` and `MeasurementsAddScreen`; preserve `upsertCheckIn` omitted-vs-null semantics.
- "Import Full History" (`ImportHistoryScreen`, reached from `SyncScreen`) is a one-time resumable backfill: `backfillService.ts` walks 30-day day-aligned windows newest-first from start-of-today down to a probe-derived floor (`readEarliestRecord` on both providers), one upload per window, with a per-server checkpoint in `backfillCheckpoint.ts`. It never advances `lastSyncedTime` and never runs writeback; while it runs, `isBackfillRunning()` (autoSyncCoordinator) makes background sync skip.
- The backfill's metric set is FROZEN in its checkpoint at first run; resume uses the frozen set verbatim and toggle changes require Start Over. Quota exhaustion, locked device, and app-inactive are expected mid-run stops — the checkpoint keeps them resumable.

## Health Writeback

- Writeback sends Sparky diary nutrition and hydration back to Apple Health on iOS and Health Connect on Android.
- Platform split: `services/writeback.ios.ts` re-exports `healthkit/writeback.ts`; `services/writeback.ts` re-exports `healthconnect/writeback.ts`.
- `runWriteback()` runs after inbound sync in its own try/catch. Writeback failures must not block inbound sync results.
- Writeback is opt-in per metric and gated on write permissions. Android production permissions include `WRITE_NUTRITION` and `WRITE_HYDRATION`; other write permissions are dev-only.
- Imported health entries are skipped to avoid echo loops. iOS sets the app bundle id as the own-source guard; Android relies on source metadata.
- Per-day content-signature hashing skips unchanged days. Each run deletes prior tracked UUIDs then saves fresh records; failed deletes are retried next run.
- `HealthDataWriteback` on `SyncScreen` owns the remove flow. `BottomSheetPicker` offers all-time purge or date range through `DateRangeSheet`; both call `removeWrittenData(range)` and clear tracking.
- Inbound iOS nutrition sync reads food correlations with a rolling nutrition lookback and upserts by `(source, source_id)` server-side.

## Native Patches

- `react-native-health-connect` is declared as `^3.5.3`; the installed 3.5.3 build is patched from the repo root via `pnpm.patchedDependencies`.
- Patch file: `../patches/react-native-health-connect@3.5.3.patch`.
- The patch changes Android `getAggregateGroupByPeriodRequest` implementations from instant-based `getTimeRangeFilter` to local-date-time `getTimeRangeFilterLocal` for non-Steps record types. This protects per-day grouping around DST and local-day boundaries.
- `@bacons/apple-targets@4.0.6` is patched via `../patches/@bacons__apple-targets@4.0.6.patch`, fixing two upstream bugs. First, its xcode pass matched "its" extension target by type with a fall-back to any same-type target, which adopted and corrupted the expo-widgets `ExpoWidgetsTarget` on a clean prebuild; the patch scopes the match to an exact product-name hit. Second, the existing-target update path crashed every non-clean prebuild (EvanBacon/expo-apple-targets#201): removing the old build configuration list's referrers cleared `target.props.buildConfigurationList`, which the next line then dereferenced; the patch holds the list in a local and iterates a copy of its configurations so none are skipped mid-removal.
- After changing a patch or upgrading a patched package, run `pnpm install` from the repo root and then `npx expo prebuild --clean` from mobile before native validation.

## Food, Meals, Units, And Photo Estimates

- Food search spans local foods, online providers, meals, barcode scan, label scan, and AI photo estimates. Keep `FoodSearchScreen`, `FoodScanScreen`, `FoodEntryAddScreen`, `FoodFormScreen`, `FoodPhotoFlow`, and route params aligned.
- `LibraryScreen` is the hub for saved Foods, Meals, recurring Meal Plans, Exercises, and Workout Presets. Full lists live in `FoodsLibraryScreen`, `MealsLibraryScreen`, `MealPlansScreen`, `ExercisesLibraryScreen`, and `WorkoutPresetsLibraryScreen`.
- Food detail/edit flow: `FoodDetailScreen`, `FoodFormScreen`, `FoodForm`, `FoodUnitSelectorSheet`, `useFoodVariants`, `useFoodsLibrary`, `useDeleteFood`, `foodsApi`, and `utils/foodDetails.ts`.
- `FoodForm` supports equivalent serving sizes grouped by nutrient signature, auto-scale nutrition, compatible unit conversion via `convertServingSizeOnUnitChange`, optional AI cross-category unit conversion, custom nutrients, and caller-provided `headerChildren`.
- `EditBarcodeScreen` lets users add or remove extra barcodes for a saved food. Keep `FoodDetailScreen`, `EditBarcodeScreen`, `foodsApi`, and the `EditBarcode` route params aligned.
- Meal templates use `MealAddScreen`, `MealDetailScreen`, `FoodSearch` / `FoodEntryAdd` with `pickerMode: 'meal-builder'`, and `services/mealBuilderSelection.ts` for pending ingredient handoff.
- Recurring meal plans use `MealPlansScreen`, `MealPlanFormScreen`, `useMealPlans`, `mealPlansApi`, and `utils/mealPlanForm.ts`. Plans can schedule any meal already visible in the user's meal library, including family/public meals, but the plan itself remains private to its owner.
- Logged-meal grouped diary entries use `foodEntryMealsApi`, `FoodEntryViewScreen`, and `EditLoggedMealScreen`. Preserve stored component nutrition snapshots when editing.
- `MealTypeDetailScreen` owns single-meal-type day views and copy-to-another-day via `useCopyFoodEntries`; be careful with custom meal types and synthetic buckets.
- External food providers use provider-agnostic v2 endpoints where possible. Provider categories and barcode support come from server config; do not hardcode provider type allowlists unless preserving an explicit fallback.
- "All Providers" aggregated search (`useAllProvidersSearch`) fans one debounced term out across every active provider in parallel — one `useQueries` entry per provider, results projected in the `combine` callback for structural sharing. Providers stream in independently; a slow or failing provider must not block the others. Open Food Facts calls go through the shared rate limiter.
- Photo mode is hidden in meal-builder mode because photo estimates log to the diary.
- `FoodPhotoFlow` is a modal native stack and wraps itself in a local `KeyboardProvider`.
- Photo availability fetches `GET /api/chat/ai-service-settings/active` through `aiSettingsApi.ts`; food photo is attempt-all, so `isFoodPhotoAvailable` gates only on a configured provider, not a specific provider type.
- Estimation posts to `POST /api/foods/estimate-food-photo` through `estimateFoodPhoto(...)` in `externalFoodSearchApi.ts` and uses typed `FoodPhotoEstimateError` codes from `@workspace/shared`.
- Food-photo request/response changes cross package boundaries: update shared schema and server route/service with mobile.
- Keep `auto_scale_online_imports` separate from Open Food Facts-specific scaling preferences in `FoodSettingsScreen`.

## Exercise, Workouts, And Fasting

- Exercise and workout preset flows use `ExerciseSearch`, `PresetSearch`, detail/form screens, paginated/search hooks, mutation hooks, and shared workout payload helpers in `utils/workoutSession.ts`.
- Session responses are discriminated unions from `@workspace/shared`: preset workouts and individual activity sessions have different shapes. Keep detail/edit screens type-safe.
- Workout/activity drafts are persisted by `workoutDraftService`; `useWorkoutForm`, `useActivityForm`, and `useDraftPersistence` own form state.
- Exercise selection returns via `CommonActions.setParams` and a nonce pattern through `useSelectedExercise`.
- Rest timer state lives in `stores/activeWorkoutStore.ts`; notifications are scheduled through `services/notifications.ts`. The rest-complete ping carries a background "Complete Set" action (`rest-complete` category): responses are routed to `completeActiveSetIfReady` by `initWorkoutNotificationActions` (exported from the store, wired in App startup — the response listener cannot live in `notifications.ts` without a store↔service import cycle), and stale delivered pings are swept when the next rest is scheduled.
- Set IDs are preserved server-side across workout edits so the active workout cursor stays attached to the right row.
- Rest duration is configurable per exercise via `RestPeriodChip` / `RestPeriodSheet` and is forwarded through `buildExercisesPayload`. New exercises/sets and null `rest_time` fallbacks seed from the `defaultRestSec` app preference via `getDefaultRestSec()` (Settings → Workout Settings), not a hardcoded constant.
- Fasting uses `FastingDetailScreen`, `FastingCard`, `FastingProtocolSheet`, `useFasting`, `useFastingTimer`, `utils/fasting.ts`, and `services/api/fastingApi.ts`.
- `FastingGoalReconciler` is mounted headlessly on `DashboardScreen`; it owns goal-notification reconciliation and app-resume refetch even when the visible fasting card is hidden.
- Fasting goal notifications are gated by the app notifications toggle; ending/canceling a fast clears scheduled notifications.

## Dashboard, Diary, Measurements, And Nutrients

- `DashboardScreen` and `DiaryScreen` share date navigation patterns and support gesture-driven date movement.
- `DashboardScreen` drives hydration quick-add, card visibility, fasting summary, health trends, and widget sync.
- `DiaryScreen` owns meal type sections, measurement summaries, serving quick-adjust, swipe/long-press deletes, and AddSheet date propagation.
- `DashboardSettingsScreen` controls dashboard card visibility and custom nutrient display preferences, and is the entry point to `HealthTrendsSettingsScreen`.
- `HealthTrendsSettingsScreen` orders and hides the Health Trends graphs. One drag list holds the shown graphs, a `Hidden` divider, then the hidden ones; dragging a graph across the divider is what hides or shows it, so there are no switches. Every row including the divider shares `REORDER_ROW_HEIGHT`, keeping the stride uniform for the reorder worklets it shares with `WorkoutReorderList` and `MealTypeSettingsScreen` (`useReorderRowGeometry`, `useReorderRowPreviewStyle`, `createReorderRowPanGesture`, `resetReorderDragPreview`, all exported from `components/WorkoutReorderList.tsx`). Register a new graph in `constants/healthTrends.ts`; `HealthTrendsPager`'s render map is a total `Record<HealthTrendKey, ...>`, so registering one without rendering it is a compile error.
- Progress photos live in one screen, `ProgressPhotosScreen`: the selected day's three angles with their management on top (`PhotoDaySlots`, date picked through `CalendarSheet`), over a timeline of that angle's recent shoots, each row carrying its weight and the delta against the previous one - a preview rather than the archive, see the History note below. `ProgressPhotoCompareScreen` (two days side by side) and `ProgressPhotoTimelapseScreen` (cross-faded playback) hang off it. Reached from the `AddSheet` row and `ProgressPhotosCard` on the Dashboard, both passing an optional `date`. `ProgressPhotoViewer` is the full-screen pinch-zoom viewer - deliberately not `ImageLightbox`, which resolves URIs through the food image source context and takes plain string URLs.
- `ProgressPhotosCard` is scoped to the Dashboard's selected day, not the latest shoot whenever it was: every other card there answers for the selected date, so a card showing a different day read as today's photo and contradicted the date in the header. It reads the day off the gallery rather than the per-day endpoint because it shows that day's weight, which only the gallery carries. It gates that query on `progressPhotosCardVisible`, so a hidden card costs no request at app open, and prompts into the day when it has no photos rather than hiding itself - nothing else on the Dashboard advertises the feature.
- Adding and removing write immediately rather than staging behind a Save: this screen is somewhere you browse, and unsaved state plus a back-guard does not belong on it. One pick is one request, so uploads stay serial anyway. Replacing needs no delete first because the server upserts on `(user_id, entry_date, photo_type)`; removal confirms first.
- `PhotoDaySlots` shows all three angles at once so a day's gaps read at a glance. Viewing and managing are separate targets on purpose - the photo opens the viewer, a corner button opens replace/remove - because a long-press would hide the only way to replace a photo behind an undiscoverable gesture.
- History is a preview, not the archive: it lists the `HISTORY_PREVIEW_LIMIT` (7) most recent shoots for the angle, with a line under the heading saying so and pointing at Compare / Time-lapse. Counted in shoots rather than calendar days because a weekly shooter would see one row and no delta under a seven-day window. The cut happens **after** the deltas are computed, so the oldest visible row still compares against the shoot before it; and `canCompare` reads the full history, not the preview, or the two tools the line recommends would be disabled for the people sent to them.
- The screen carries **two** angle concepts, which is its one real ambiguity: the day block is angle-agnostic and always shows all three, while the `SegmentedControl` under the History heading scopes the timeline and the Compare / Time-lapse params. Keep them in separate blocks so position tells them apart, and query the control by its `tab` role in tests since the angle names appear twice on screen.
- The comparison loads only the two photos on screen: each pane picks its day through `CalendarSheet` (marked with the days that have that angle) rather than a thumbnail strip, which used to mount one image per shoot. The time-lapse mounts one frame and prefetches `PREFETCH_AHEAD` (3) beyond it, and its header menu windows playback to 30 days / 3 months / all time or a range picked in `DateRangeSheet`. Every window is evaluated as absolute `YYYY-MM-DD` bounds, presets included, so there is one filter rather than a relative and an absolute one. An empty preset window falls back to all time so an old history is not a dead screen; a custom range does not, because widening dates the user picked by hand would misreport what is in them.
- `CheckInPhotosSummary` sits under `MeasurementsSummary` in the diary: the day's angles as small thumbnails, a gap where one is missing, and a tap into `ProgressPhotos` on that same date. Both halves are one check-in, keyed on `(user_id, entry_date)` server-side. It carries no weight or delta because the measurements summary directly above already shows them. A day with no photos gets the same `Tap to add photos` prompt food and exercise get, so the row is a way in and not just a readout.
- `DiaryScreen` owns that day's photo query and passes them down as a prop, the way it already does for measurements. It needs the same answer itself: a photo is something the user recorded, so it defeats `isDayEmpty` exactly as a logged supplement does - the summary lives in the non-empty branch, so a predicate that ignored photos would hide them on the very day they were taken. That arm is gated on the query's load like the sleep arm above it, or a day with photos flashes the empty illustration until they arrive.
- `PhotoDayWeight` renders the weight under a photo and, when the day has none, a prompt into `MeasurementsAdd` for that date. Used by the gallery, comparison and time-lapse; the Dashboard card keeps plain text because the card is already a touchable.
- `CalendarSheet` takes an optional `markedDates`; Dashboard and Diary pass the photo days, fetched on first open of the picker rather than at mount (`useCheckInPhotoDates(calendarOpened)`).
- Custom nutrients are fetched via `useCustomNutrients` from `GET /api/custom-nutrients`; nutrient display preferences use full-array replace through `preferencesApi.ts`.
- Nutrient metadata and defaults live in `constants/nutrients.ts`; aggregation and visibility toggling live in `utils/nutrientUtils.ts`.
- Measurements and water routes are in `measurementsApi.ts`; date-sensitive flows should preserve calendar-day strings and shared timezone helpers.

## Chat (Ask Sparky)

- `Chat` is a root-stack route (`src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`), reached from `AddSheet`'s "Ask Sparky" row and an optional dashboard card gated by the `askSparkyVisible` preference.
- The thread is an assistant-ui runtime: `@assistant-ui/react-native` primitives plus `useChatRuntime` / `AssistantChatTransport` from `@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk`, streaming from `POST /api/chat/stream` (AI SDK UI message stream protocol).
- The transport must use `expo/fetch` — it exposes a real `ReadableStream` body. RN's global fetch buffers responses and silently breaks incremental streaming.
- Auth and proxy headers are resolved per request through an async `headers` callback; `service_config_id` (the user's active AI provider) is merged into the request body and required by the server.
- `chatApi.ts` is history persistence only: `GET /api/chat/sparky-chat-history` and `POST /api/chat/clear-all-history`. `useChatHistory` seeds the runtime with prior messages and uses `staleTime`/`gcTime` of 0 because the runtime ignores `messages` changes after mount — every chat open must re-seed cold.
- Chat UI lives in `components/chat/`: `MarkdownMessage` (`react-native-enriched-markdown` + `remend` to repair unclosed streamed markdown), `ToolCallCard` (derives running/complete/error from `result`/`isError`), `TypingIndicator`. Tool-name display mapping lives in `constants/chat.ts`.
- There is no chat Zustand store; thread state lives in the assistant-ui runtime and history seeding in React Query.

## Auth, Networking, And Settings

- Server configs support `apiKey` and `session` auth. URLs/IDs are in AsyncStorage; API keys, session tokens, and proxy headers are in SecureStore.
- `OnboardingScreen` handles first-run setup, session sign-in, API keys, MFA, theme, external food source defaults, and finish-without-connection.
- `ServerSettingsScreen` handles server list management, active server switching, connection tests, web dashboard launch, and `ServerConfigModal`.
- `useAuth`, `ReauthModal`, `ServerConfigModal`, `authService.ts`, and `MfaForm` coordinate auth recovery, MFA, session expiry, and API-key fallback.
- Production rejects HTTP server URLs. Preserve HTTPS guards in onboarding, settings, raw fetch paths, and health sync.
- Proxy headers support reverse-proxy auth. They must be injected before auth headers in `apiClient.ts` and raw fetch clients.
- During login before a config is saved, `authService` manages pending proxy headers via `setPendingProxyHeaders()` / `clearPendingProxyHeaders()`.
- Prefer `getApiErrorMessage` / API error helpers over ad hoc error parsing in UI.

## Logging And Diagnostics

- `LogService.ts` is the single source of truth for app logs. Prefer `addLog(message, status?, details?)` over `console.*`.
- Valid log statuses are `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR`. Legacy `SUCCESS` is migrated to `INFO` on read.
- Capture and view filtering are separate thresholds; do not conflate storage filtering with `LogScreen` filtering.
- Use structured `details` arrays for diagnostic context instead of cramming multiline strings into `message`.
- `diagnosticReportService.ts` and `healthDiagnosticService.ts` power diagnostic exports. Android-only raw Health Connect diagnostics belong in `healthDiagnosticService.ts`.

## Styling And UI

- Styling uses Uniwind with TailwindCSS v4 tokens in `global.css`.
- Themes are Light, Dark, AMOLED, and System. `themeService.ts` owns persistence; `App.tsx` syncs Android navigation bar style.
- Many visual components read CSS variables with `useCSSVariable`, especially Skia charts and themed controls.
- Animate Skia paths from Reanimated `useSharedValue` / `useDerivedValue`, not Skia's deprecated animation API.
- `Icon.tsx` maps semantic names to SF Symbols on iOS and Ionicons on Android; verify identifiers before adding icons.
- Use shared primitives where they fit: `FormInput`, `Button`, `SettingsRow`, `SettingsRowGroup`, `SegmentedControl`, `StepperInput`, `BottomSheetPicker`, `CalendarSheet`, `DateRangeSheet`, `AnchoredMenu`, and `FormScreenChrome`.
- `DateRangeSheet` takes optional `title` and `confirmLabel`; they default to the writeback removal wording, so a consumer that is not removing anything (the time-lapse) must pass its own. It also takes `markedDates`, like `CalendarSheet`: both dot their days through the shared `useMarkedDayComponent` (`components/calendarMarkedDays.tsx`), which inverts the dot on a selected day and on either end of a range, and supplies no `Day` override at all when there is nothing to mark so every other caller keeps the library's own cell.
- `BottomSheetPicker`, `CalendarSheet`, and sheets shown over native modals use `FullWindowOverlay` on iOS to avoid nested-provider inset bugs.
- Keep button text and compact cards within their stable dimensions across mobile sizes. Avoid layout shifts from dynamic labels, loading states, or icon swaps.

## Widgets And Native Config

- iOS widgets live under `targets/widget/`, share data through the app group from `app.identifiers.js`, and reload through `ExtensionStorage` in `useWidgetSync`.
- Current iOS widgets are calorie and macro widgets. When changing display, update Swift views, shared helpers, TS snapshot shape, and reload kind handling together.
- Widget string keys are derived from the Swift sources, not tracked by hand: `__tests__/config/helpers/widgetSwiftKeys.ts` discovers every `.swift` file under `targets/widget/` (recursively) and extracts the literal keys passed to `localizedWidgetString`, `configurationDisplayName` and `.description`. A new key must therefore be added to `targets/widget/en.lproj/Localizable.strings`, and — for `localizedWidgetString` keys — to the `fallbackWidgetString` map, or the contract tests fail. Target-language files stay optional and fall back to EN.
- Android widgets live under `targets/android-widget/`. `plugins/withCalorieWidget.ts` copies Kotlin/templates/resources, registers receivers, wires the native module package, and documents the pattern for adding another widget.
- `src/services/CalorieWidgetBridge.ts` is the JS bridge for Android widget snapshot writes and Glance reloads.
- The scheduled "Rest complete" alert fires exactly only with the `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` special access ("Alarms & reminders", user-granted, denied by default on Android 13+) — without it expo-notifications falls back to inexact alarms the OS batches ~15s late. The `targets/android-exact-alarm/` Kotlin module (registered by `plugins/withExactAlarmModule.ts`) exposes `canScheduleExactAlarms`/`openExactAlarmSettings` through `src/services/ExactAlarmBridge.ts`; `maybePromptForExactAlarmPermission` in `notifications.ts` owns the one-time grant prompt at workout start.
- Widget snapshot shape is owned by `useWidgetSync.ts`; keep it aligned with Swift views and Kotlin composables.
- The workout Live Activity (Lock Screen + Dynamic Island elapsed/rest timers) uses `expo-widgets`, whose generated `ExpoWidgetsTarget` extension coexists with the `@bacons/apple-targets` `targets/widget/` target. `src/services/WorkoutLiveActivityLayout.tsx` is the `'widget'`-directive layout (self-contained; only `@expo/ui/swift-ui` imports; epoch-ms props, never `Date`s) and must only be imported from `src/services/workoutLiveActivity.ios.ts` — `createLiveActivity` runs at module scope and would drag iOS native modules into the Android bundle. The `.ios.ts` service subscribes to `activeWorkoutStore` (ops held until persist hydration + instance reconcile) and serializes all start/update/end calls; the OS ticks the timers from absolute timestamps, no polling — the app pushes an update only on a real state change. The rest "+15s"/"Skip" and active-phase "Complete" buttons (iOS 17+; inert below 17) fire a `LiveActivityIntent` that runs in the app process and lands in the service via `addUserInteractionListener`, which dispatches to store actions; the button `target` strings are duplicated by hand between layout and service because the `'widget'` body cannot import them. A press after a force-quit is lost (the event fires before JS boots). The rest progress bar is an OS-ticked `ProgressView timerInterval`; the `bannerSmall` slot targets the watchOS Smart Stack/CarPlay and stays button-free. Live Activities get NO `widgets[]` entry in `app.config.ts` (that array is only for home/Lock Screen widgets).
- `app.config.ts` controls bundle identifiers, Apple team IDs, iOS app group, Android permissions, navigation bar contrast, widget plugins, and production-only network security config.
- `APP_VARIANT` selects dev vs production behavior; dev builds request extra Android Health Connect write permissions for local testing/seeding.
- After editing `targets/`, native config plugins, app groups, permissions, or native bridge shape, run `npx expo prebuild --clean`.

## Shared Workspace Contracts

- `@workspace/shared` lives at `../shared/` and is source-first in this workspace.
- Prefer shared schemas and constants for API request/response contracts, exercise/workout types, precision constants, calorie constants, and timezone utilities.
- Keep `YYYY-MM-DD` values as calendar-day strings until a database or external API boundary requires UTC instants.
- For day-string logic, prefer shared timezone helpers such as `isDayString`, `addDays`, `compareDays`, `localDateToDay`, `todayInZone`, `instantToDay`, `dayToUtcRange`, and `dayRangeToUtcRange`.
- Mobile API contract changes usually require matching server and often web checks. Food photo, shared schemas, nutrition, meal copy, and auth changes are common cross-package surfaces.

## Server API Orientation

All endpoints require auth headers, and proxy headers are injected before auth headers when configured. Key mobile clients:

- `healthDataApi.ts` - `POST /api/health-data`, identity checks, chunking, timeout, retry, session-expiry handling.
- `dailySummaryApi.ts`, `goalsApi.ts`, `measurementsApi.ts`, `preferencesApi.ts` - daily summary, goals, check-ins, water, timezone bootstrap, nutrient display preferences.
- `checkInPhotosApi.ts` - progress photos: the gallery (every photo with that day's weight, in one request), a day's photos, the days that have any, multipart upload and delete. Image bytes come from the authenticated `/file/{id}` route, so `useCheckInPhotoSource` attaches auth and proxy headers and memoizes each source by photo id.
- `foodEntriesApi.ts`, `foodEntryMealsApi.ts`, `foodsApi.ts`, `mealsApi.ts`, `mealTypesApi.ts`, `mealPlansApi.ts` - diary food entries, grouped logged meals, saved foods/variants/barcodes, saved meals, meal types, and recurring meal plans.
- `externalFoodSearchApi.ts`, `aiSettingsApi.ts`, `aiConversionApi.ts` - provider-agnostic food search/details/barcode, label/photo estimate, AI availability, unit conversion.
- `exerciseApi.ts`, `externalExerciseSearchApi.ts`, `workoutPresetsApi.ts` - exercise history, suggested/search/import flows, preset/individual exercise sessions, workout presets.
- `fastingApi.ts` - `POST /api/fasting/start`, `POST /api/fasting/end`, and current/stats/history reads.
- `authService.ts`, `profileApi.ts`, `externalProvidersApi.ts`, `customNutrientsApi.ts` - auth/session/MFA, profile, configured providers, custom nutrient definitions.
- `ChatScreen.tsx` (transport) + `chatApi.ts` - streaming chat via `POST /api/chat/stream`, history load/clear.

When reviewing an API issue, trace screen/hook -> API client -> server route -> service/repository -> shared schema before judging the fix. Deeper endpoint docs live in mobile `docs/` (`food_api.md`, `sync_api.md`, `measurements_api.md`, `external_providers.md`, `healthkit.md`, `bg_sync.md`).

## Localization And Reactive Helpers

- React UI gets `t` from `useTranslation()`; user-facing utility helpers accept an injected `TFunction` and never hide singleton `i18n.t()` fallbacks.
- Pass `t` through every presentation helper and include it in `useMemo` / `useCallback` dependencies when the derived result contains localized text; this keeps mounted UI correct after a runtime language switch.
- Translation keys are semantic and statically analyzable. Every static `defaultValue` is the English source fallback and must exactly match the EN catalog entry.
- A key used with `count` is a plural family: EN requires `_one` and `_other`; PL requires `_one`, `_few`, `_many`, and `_other`. Use grammatically correct forms rather than duplicating suffixes blindly.
- Run `pnpm run i18n:audit` after localization work. `pnpm run validate` includes typecheck, lint with zero warnings, and this audit.
- Keep canonical storage/API values and user-generated content literal; localize only application-owned presentation labels.

## Testing Guidance

- Tests live in `__tests__/` with `jest-expo`, `jsdom`, and `jest.setup.js`.
- Run related tests for the touched surface, then lint/typecheck for cross-cutting changes.
- Run the full single-run suite after broad refactors, shared mock changes, navigation rewiring, root provider changes, import-path moves, native config changes, public type changes, or global mock edits.
- Be careful with global mocks in `jest.setup.js`; mock pollution can fail unrelated files.
- On macOS, Jest resolves `.ios.ts` by default. Android-specific service tests should require the Android file explicitly:

```ts
const androidService = require('../../src/services/healthConnectService.ts');
```

- Health sync changes: rerun `useSyncHealthData`, `backgroundSyncService`, `healthDataApi`, `healthConnectService`, `healthConnectService.ios`, and relevant `services/healthconnect` / `services/healthkit` tests.
- Health writeback changes: rerun `healthconnect/writeback`, `healthkit/writeback`, writeback mapper tests, `HealthDataWriteback`, `backgroundSyncService`, notifications where relevant, and sync tests.
- Food library/form/unit/barcode changes: rerun `FoodForm`, `FoodUnitSelectorSheet`, `LibraryScreen`, `FoodDetailScreen`, `FoodFormScreen`, `EditBarcodeScreen`, `useFoodsLibrary`, `useFoodVariants`, `useDeleteFood`, `foodsApi`, `foodDetails`, and unit conversion tests.
- Meal template/logged-meal changes: rerun meals library/detail/add/edit screens, `MealTypeDetailScreen`, copy meal tests, food search/entry picker tests, meal hooks/API tests, and meal builder/nutrition utils.
- Exercise/workout/preset changes: rerun exercise/preset library/detail/form/search/mutation tests, workout/activity form and draft tests, active workout store tests, rest-period tests, and `workoutSession` tests.
- Fasting changes: rerun `FastingCard`, `FastingGoalReconciler`, `FastingDetailScreen`, `useFasting`, `useFastingTimer`, `fastingApi`, notification tests, and fasting utility/constant tests.
- Diary quick-adjust/delete changes: rerun swipe row, serving adjustment, food entry update/delete, meal-type detail, and exercise mutation tests.
- Food scan/photo changes: rerun food scan, food photo flow screens, AI settings/external food APIs, food photo intro, food photo utils, and haptics tests.
- Settings/auth/networking changes: rerun onboarding, server settings, server config modal, auth hooks/services, storage, API client, raw fetch client tests, and proxy-header tests.
- Widgets/HUD/tab/add-sheet changes: rerun `useWidgetSync`, active workout store, `AddSheet`, `CustomTabBar`, `ActiveWorkoutBar`, and error-boundary tests.

## Quick Routing

- Settings/diagnostics bug: inspect settings screens, `SettingsRow`, haptics/theme/sounds/notification services, diagnostics services, `DevTools`, and screen error boundaries.

## Priority Rule

- For work inside `SparkyFitnessMobile/`, this file is the package guide.
- If a task also changes another package, combine this with that package guide instead of stretching this file to cover the whole monorepo.
