/**
 * Collapses its children to zero height (fading as it goes) while the keyboard
 * is up, tied to the keyboard's own animation curve, and restores them on
 * dismiss. Hands vertical space back to a scrollable log exactly when the user
 * is typing — used on the active workout screen for the exercise rail and the
 * header's progress row.
 *
 * The child's natural height is measured on first layout; `keyboardProgress`
 * (a shared value) then drives the collapse on the UI thread. On Android the
 * animated clip re-lays the measured View out at partial heights while the
 * collapse runs, so layout events are only trusted while the keyboard is
 * closed (`keyboardProgress` at 0).
