/**
 * A labeled multiline notes input with a local draft, committed on blur and
 * flushed again on unmount. Dumb by design — the parent owns persistence
 * (per-set via `updateSetField`, per-exercise via `setExerciseNotes`). Shared
 * by the per-set row expand and the per-exercise card note (rule of two).
 *
 * The draft re-seeds whenever the incoming `value` changes: the field can be
 * pointed at a different set (expand target switch) or an autosave
 * reconciliation can rewrite the session under a mounted field, so a one-shot
 * `useState` initializer is not enough. Uses the same render-phase re-seed
 * pattern `ActiveWorkoutSetRow` uses for its drafts. Commits fire only on blur
 * and unmount (never mid-edit), so a re-seed can't clobber text a user is
 * typing — the store doesn't move under a focused field.

  // re-seeds the draft to match, so it won't be re-applied here.
