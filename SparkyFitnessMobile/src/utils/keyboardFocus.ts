 * native focus request can win view focus while the IME's showSoftInput is
 * silently dropped (OEM-dependent; reported on Samsung), leaving a cursor
 * with no keyboard — and a plain re-focus() can't repair it because
 * TextInputState bails out when the field is already focused. The retries
 * instead go through KeyboardController.setFocusTo('current'), which
 * re-issues the native showSoftInput for the focused view; when the keyboard
 * came up normally they are skipped or no-op.
 *
 * Returns a cleanup that cancels pending retries, shaped for an effect return.
