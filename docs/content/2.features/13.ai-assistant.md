## Troubleshooting AI Providers

Most "OpenAI Compatible / OpenRouter isn't working" reports come from provider configuration, not from SparkyFitness itself. The most common cases:

### OpenRouter: "No allowed providers are available for the selected model" (HTTP 404)

This is an **OpenRouter account setting**, not a SparkyFitness error. OpenRouter serves each model through one or more upstream providers. If your account is restricted to a subset of providers, a model whose upstream is excluded fails with this 404 — this most often hits the free (`:free`) models, which run on providers you may not have enabled.

The error body shows the mismatch directly:

- `available_providers` — the providers that can actually serve the model
- `requested_providers` — the providers your account currently allows

**Fix:** In your OpenRouter account settings, review the allowed-providers / data-policy preferences, then either enable the provider that serves your chosen model **or** pick a model served by a provider you already allow (e.g. an `openai/`, `anthropic/`, or `google/` model if those are your allowed upstreams).

### Every request 404s (doubled URL)

If your custom URL already ends in `/chat/completions`, SparkyFitness appends its own path and the request 404s.

**Fix:** Enter only the base URL ending in `/v1` — for example `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`. For local servers such as LM Studio or Ollama, use an admin/global AI setting or enable [`ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_AI=true`](/install/environment-variables) on a trusted self-hosted deployment. SparkyFitness adds `/chat/completions` for you.

### "Model not found" or empty/garbled responses

The model name must be one your endpoint actually hosts. OpenAI names like `gpt-4o-mini` will not exist on most compatible servers.

**Fix:** For the **OpenAI Compatible** and **Custom** service types, enable **Use custom model** and enter your server's own model name.

### Chat works, but photo analysis or label scan fails

Food-photo analysis and nutrition-label scanning request **structured JSON output**; plain chat does not. This is done to improve the quality of results. Some models and servers do not support structured output and reject those requests while chat still works.

**Fix:** Choose a model that supports structured outputs / JSON mode. On OpenRouter, a model's page lists whether it supports "structured outputs".

### Local servers (LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp)

These usually run without an API key — leave the **API Key** field blank. Use the OpenAI-compatible base URL the server exposes, for example `http://localhost:1234/v1` (LM Studio) or `http://localhost:11434/v1` (Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

Local/private AI URLs are resolved from the backend server's network, not from the browser. To prevent regular users from turning the server into a private-network proxy, private AI URLs are allowed for current admins, global admin-created AI settings, or deployments that explicitly set [`ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_AI=true`](/install/environment-variables).

### Running the chatbot on small local models (Ollama)

Small local models (roughly 3B–8B, e.g. an 8 GB Mac) can drive the chatbot's tools well, but two settings make the difference between "works great" and "acts dumb":

1. **Raise Ollama's context window.** Ollama defaults to a 4096-token context and **silently truncates** anything longer — which chops the tool definitions and system prompt mid-way and produces wrong or malformed tool calls. Raise it before anything else:
   - Set `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384` on the Ollama server (e.g. `launchctl setenv OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH 16384` on macOS, then restart Ollama), **or**
   - Bake `PARAMETER num_ctx 16384` into a Modelfile (`ollama create my-model -f Modelfile`) and point the service at that model.
   - On an 8 GB machine, start at `8192` — context uses VRAM — and only go higher if responses stay fast.
2. **Use the `core` tool profile.** When you add an Ollama service, SparkyFitness now preselects the **core** tool profile (in the service's settings). Core exposes the everyday logging tools plus goals (~20 tools) instead of the full ~35, which small models select from far more reliably and which fits a smaller context window. Pick **full** only on a strong local machine with a raised context window.

The server logs a warning when an Ollama service runs the `full` profile, since that combination most often overflows the default context. Also prefer models trained for tool calling (e.g. `qwen2.5:7b-instruct`, `llama3.1:8b`) — plain small chat models make unreliable tool calls.
