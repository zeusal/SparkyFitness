## 1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Algorithms

Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) represents the energy your body requires to perform basic life-sustaining functions at rest. SparkyFitness supports multiple clinical formulas to estimate BMR:

| Algorithm                       | Required Inputs             | Best For                          | Formula                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------ | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mifflin-St Jeor** _(Default)_ | Age, Gender, Height, Weight | General population                | $\text{Male: } 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5$<br>$\text{Female: } 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161$                          |
| **Revised Harris-Benedict**     | Age, Gender, Height, Weight | Historical comparison             | $\text{Male: } 13.397W + 4.799H - 5.677A + 88.362$<br>$\text{Female: } 9.247W + 3.098H - 4.33A + 447.593$ |
| **Katch-McArdle**               | Weight, Body Fat %          | Individuals with tracked body fat | $370 + 21.6 \times \text{LBM}$<br>_(LBM = Lean Body Mass)_                                                |
| **Cunningham**                  | Weight, Body Fat %          | Highly athletic/muscular builds   | $500 + 22 \times \text{LBM}$                                                                              |
| **Oxford**                      | Weight, Gender              | Varied age groups & demographics  | $\text{Male: } 14.2W + 593$<br>$\text{Female: } 10.9W + 677$                                              |

_Note: Weight ($W$) is in kg, Height ($H$) is in cm, and Age ($A$) is in years._

## 2. Body Fat Algorithms

Body Fat Percentage is used directly in lean-mass BMR formulas (Katch-McArdle/Cunningham). SparkyFitness can estimate body fat percentage from your measurements using two algorithms:

### U.S. Navy Method

Uses circumferences to estimate body fat. Measurements are converted to inches for the standard formula:

- **Males:** $86.01 \times \log_{10}(\text{waist} - \text{neck}) - 70.041 \times \log_{10}(\text{height}) + 36.76$
- **Females:** $163.205 \times \log_{10}(\text{waist} + \text{hips} - \text{neck}) - 97.684 \times \log_{10}(\text{height}) - 78.387$

### BMI Method

Uses height, weight, and age to estimate body fat:

- **Males:** $1.2 \times \text{BMI} + 0.23 \times \text{Age} - 16.2$
- **Females:** $1.2 \times \text{BMI} + 0.23 \times \text{Age} - 5.4$
- _(where $\text{BMI} = \text{Weight (kg)} / \text{Height (m)}^2$)_

## 3. Daily Calorie Goal Adjustment

This setting determines **how physical activity changes your calorie budget** throughout the day:

- **Adaptive TDEE:** Dynamically computes your metabolic expenditure by correlating your actual weight changes with your historical calorie intake over the last 35 days. _(Best for high-precision tracking)._
  - **Expenditure (Adaptive TDEE):** On the Diary page, "Expenditure" represents your calculated Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). This is the baseline number from which your deficit/surplus is subtracted.
  - **Fallback Behavior:** If you have insufficient history (less than 14 days of weight and calorie data, or fewer than 7 days of calorie entries $\ge 200\text{ kcal}$), the system will use a fallback estimate based on the standard `BMR × Activity Multiplier` formula until enough data is collected.
- **Dynamic Goal:** Increases your budget as you burn active calories or take steps (adds exercise directly back to your budget).
- **Fixed Goal:** Your calorie target remains completely static, ignoring daily exercise.
- **Percentage Earn-Back:** Adds back a custom percentage (e.g., $50\%$) of active calories burned to create a buffer against device calorie over-estimations.
- **Device Projection:** Projects your total full-day burn by extrapolating active steps and device data to midnight (MyFitnessPal style).

## 4. Goal Mode & Caloric Deficits

**Goal Mode** applies a body composition percentage-based deficit or maintenance target to your baseline maintenance:

| Goal Mode              | Deficit Percentage    | Target Purpose                              |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Maintain**           | $0\%$                 | Weight maintenance                          |
| **Body Recomposition** | $10\%$                | Gain muscle while losing fat simultaneously |
| **Cut**                | $15\%$                | Steady fat loss                             |
| **High Cut**           | $20\%$                | Aggressive fat loss                         |
| **Manual**             | Custom ($0\% - 40\%$) | Personalized deficit rate                   |

### Calculation Methods

- **Adaptive Method:** Applies the deficit to your Calculated Adaptive TDEE (falling back to BMR × activity multiplier if history is insufficient).
- **Manual Method:** Applies the deficit to your manually entered calorie target.

## 5. Metabolic Safety Floors

To protect long-term metabolic health and avoid muscle wasting, SparkyFitness checks all calorie goals against safety limits:

1.  **Resting Metabolism (RMR) Floor:** Your target should not fall below your resting metabolic rate.
2.  **Absolute Clinical Floor:** $1,200$ kcal for biological females; $1,500$ kcal for biological males.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Enforcement Behavior:**
>
> - Under the **Adaptive** method, if your calculated target falls below the safety floor, the system **automatically raises** your target to the effective floor.
> - Under the **Manual** method, the target is **not automatically raised**, but a prominent warning banner is displayed warning you that your budget is in an unsafe range.
